## Purpose

- Analyze data from social media sites to understand how certain groups are trying to manipulate the election. 
- Once initial data has been analyzed, we will form a hypothesis on what we believe will affect the 2020 election results. 

As we continue to collect more data, we will utilize machine learning algorithms to break down data sets coherently and come to logical conclusions.

## Social Media Data Scraping

In order to perform analysis we had to get all the necessary data from the different social network platforms. 

Our group used Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) to scrape information related to the elections using certain hashtags and keywords from Twitter, Instagram, Tiktok, etc.

Using all this data we can later determine which users were the most active, what were the different ways they tried to influence the elections etc.


## Data Sources

Twitter: Data collected by using tweepy

Instagram: Data collected by using instagram-scraper from GitHub

Tik Tok: Data collected by using tiktok scraper

## Data Analysis

Used NLTK sentiment analysis to analyze the sentiment of the tweets gathered using certain hashtags related to the elections.

Created word clouds for different data sets from September, October abd November with over a million tweets. The word clouds can be found under wordcloud directory in Jupyter Notebooks.


## Looking Ahead

Short term: Narrow down the patterns that active users are employing.

Long term: Use AI to analyze large data sets to help form conclusions and determine if it could have had an effect on the 2020 election.

## Work in Progress

This is a work in progress. Any recommendations or collaboration is welcome and highly appreciated!
